üå∏‚õ∞Ô∏è A highly customizable scripting-based block game framework made for the next generation.

## Goals

1. None of actual gameplay content is built-in, so basically every aspect of gameplay is changeable.
2. Add features with content packs using JSON, JavaScript, WebAssembly or Lua.
3. High performance by optimizations, intrinsic components and better dependencies.
5. Support most platforms out there: Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iOS, and iPadOS.
6. Free of charge for non-commercial users and source-available.
